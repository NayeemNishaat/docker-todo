Chapter: Init:
Install the docker desktop app!

Chapter: Create Config File:
dockerfile

// Part: Basic Config
FROM node:18
MAINTAINER nayeemnishaat@gmail.com
# RUN apk add --no-cache python2 g++ make
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
EXPOSE 3000

// Part: Explanation
Key: FROM -> It tells docker, from which base image you want to base your image from. In our example, we are creating an image from the node image. FROM instruction used to specify the valid docker image name. So specified Docker Image will be downloaded from docker hub registry if it is not exists locally.
Point: Examples:
	from docker.io/centos:latest
	from docker.io/centos:6

Key: MAINTAINER -> The next command is the person who is going to maintain this image. Here you specify the MAINTAINER keyword and just mention the email ID.
Point: Examples:
	maintainer administrator
	maintainer admin @ learnitguide.net
	maintainer devops engineer(admin @ learnitguide.net)

Key: LABEL -> LABEL instruction is used to specify metadata informations to an image. A LABEL is a key-value  pair.
Point: Examples:
	label “application_environment”=”development”
	label “application_support”=”learnitguide.net group”

Key: EXPOSE -> EXPOSE instruction is used to inform about the network ports that the container listens on runtime. Docker uses this information to interconnect containers using links and to set up port redirection on docker host system.
Point: Examples:
	expose 80 443
	expose 80/tcp 8080/udp

Key: ADD -> ADD instruction is used to copy files, directories and remote URL files to the destination (docker container) within the filesystem of the Docker Images. Add instruction also has two forms – Shell Form and Executable Form.
Point: Examples: ADD src dest
	ADD testfile data

Key: RUN -> RUN instruction is used to executes any commands on top of the current image and this will create a new layer. RUN instruction has two forms – Shell Form and Executable Form.
Point: Examples:
	run yum update
	run systemctl start httpd

Key: WORKDIR -> WORKDIR instruction is used to set the working directory.
Point: Examples:
	workdir /app/
	workdir /java_dst/

Key: COPY ->COPY instruction is used to copy files, directories and remote URL files to the destination within the filesystem of the Docker Images. COPY instruction also has two forms – Shell Form and Executable Form.
Point: Examples:
	copy src dest
	copy /root/testfile /data/
Remark: COPY . .
Note: First . -> Current Directory
Note: Second . -> WORKDIR Directory. So, in our case it will be /app!
The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>. The <dest> is an absolute path, or a path relative to WORKDIR

Key: CMD -> CMD instruction is used to set a command to be executed when running a container. There must be only one CMD in a Dockerfile. If more than one CMD is listed, only the last CMD takes effect.
Point: Examples:
	cmd ping google.com
	cmd python myapplication.py

Key: ENTRYPOINT -> ENTRYPOINT instruction is used to configure and run a container as an executable.
Point: Examples:
	entrypoint ping google.com
	entrypoint python myapplication.py

Key: VOLUME -> VOLUME instruction is used to create or mount a volume to the docker container from the docker host filesystem.
Point: Examples:
	volume /data
	volume /appdata:/appdata

Key: USER -> USER instruction is used to set the username,group name, UID and GID for running subsequent commands. Else root user will be used.
Point: Examples:
	user webadmin
	user webadmin:webgroup
	user 1008
	user 1008:1200

Key: ENV -> ENV instruction is used to set environment variables with key and value. Lets say, we want to set variables APP_DIR and app_version with the values /data and 2.0 respectively. These variables will be set during the image build also available after the container launched.
Point: Examples:
	env app_dir /data/
	env app_version 2.0

Key: ARG -> ARG instruction is also used to set environment variables with key and value, but this variables will set only during the image build not on the container.
Point: Examples:
	arg tmp_name mycustom_image
	arg tmp_ver 2.0

Key: ONBUILD -> ONBUILD instruction is used to specify a command that runs when the image in the Dockerfile is used as a base image for another image.
Point: Examples: 
	onbuild add . /app/data
	onbuild run yum install httpd

Chapter: Build Container Image
docker build -t todo .
Note: You should be in the root of the image folder befor running the command!
Key: -t is for setting a name to the image. Aka tag name.
Key: todo is the container's image name!
Key: . -> Current directory.

Chapter: Start the Container
docker run -dp 3000:3000 todo
Key: -d Means in detached mode (in the background).
Key: -p for mapping ports. host:sandbox! The sandbox port is exposed via EXPOSE 3000 command.

After all of this the app is live on http://localhost:3000 Important: This 3000 port is the port of the host!

Chapter: Re-build After Update
docker build -t getting-started .

Chapter: Start the Newly Created Image
Part: Remove the Existing Container
Key: Get all running containers -> docker ps
Key: Stop Container -> docker stop <the-container-id>
Key: Remove the Container -> docker rm <the-container-id>
Point: Stop and Remove in One Go -> docker rm -f <the-container-id>

Part: Finally Start the Updated Container docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started

Chapter: Share the  Image
Part: Log into Docker Hub
Part: Create a Repo, i.e. todo in docker hub!
Part: The image tag should be username/todo in order to be able to push to remote.
Note: Add a Tag -> docker tag todo username/todo
Note: Remove a Tag -> docker rmi todo
Part: Push to remote -> docker push username/todo:latest Remark: latest is the tag and username/todo is the repo name.

Chapter: Volume
Part: Create Volume for Persisting Data Across Multiple Containers
docker volume create todo-db
Part: Stop and Remove the todo App
docker rm -f <id>
Part: Start the todo app container, but add the -v flag to specify a volume mount. We will use the named volume and mount it to /etc/todos, which will capture all files created at the path.
docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v todo-db:/etc/todos nayeemnishaat/todo
Part: Now stop the container and restart (docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v todo-db:/etc/todos todo) and the data will be persistent.
Key: Inspect volume
docker volume inspect todo-db

Chapter: Bind Mount
Note: Start a Bind Mount -> -v "$(pwd):/app"
Part: Start dev-mode Container
docker run -dp 3000:3000 \
	-w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" \
	node:18 \
	bash -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"

Part: Explanation
Point: -dp 3000:3000 - same as before. Run in detached (background) mode and create a port mapping
Point: -w /app - sets the “working directory” or the current directory that the command will run from
Point: -v "$(pwd):/app" - bind mount the current directory from the host in the container into the /app directory
Point: node:12-alpine - the image to use. Note that this is the base image for our app from the Dockerfile
Point: sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev" - the command. We’re starting a shell using sh (alpine doesn’t have bash) and running yarn install to install all dependencies and then running yarn run dev. If we look in the package.json, we’ll see that the dev script is starting nodemon.
Point: Show Logs
docker logs -f <CONTAINER ID>
